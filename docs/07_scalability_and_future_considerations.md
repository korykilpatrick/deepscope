# 7. Scalability & Future Considerations

## Cost-Effective Prototype
- Rely on free or low-cost API tiers (SEC EDGAR, Alpha Vantage, Google FactCheck).
- Minimize LLM usage for extraction if possible (use smaller models or partial rule-based approach).
- Cache repeated claims to avoid redundant API calls.

## Caching & Performance
- **Result Caching**: If the same claim appears often, store a verified result for quick reuse.
- **Batch Requests**: Handle multiple claims together (if the external API supports it).
- **Pre-Fetching**: Download common macro data periodically rather than on each request.

## Scaling Strategies
- **Microservices**: Split out claim extraction and verification into separate deployable services.
- **Distributed Queues**: Use Celery or Pub/Sub to manage concurrent processing across worker nodes.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Add worker instances as load grows.

## Database & Analytics
- Long-term, move beyond Firebase if advanced queries or large-volume analytics are needed.
- Consider a relational or time-series DB for historical comparisons.

## Handling More Data Sources
- Integrate premium data providers (Bloomberg, FactSet) if demanded and budget allows.
- Expand coverage to international filings (e.g. companies outside the US).

## Future Enhancements
- **Continuous Learning**: Use user feedback or newly discovered official data to refine extraction or verification logic.
- **Multimodal Fact-Checking**: Extend system to handle not just text but also relevant graphs/images from financial statements.
- **Real-Time Fact-Checking**: If needed, adapt pipeline for faster response but limit the depth of checks.

By prioritizing a robust architecture and modular design now, this prototype can scale into a comprehensive financial fact-checking platform that handles large volumes, multiple data sources, and deeper analyses.
